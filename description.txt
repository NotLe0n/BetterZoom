_________________________

[c/FFE900:In Settings:]
Clicking on the Zoom or UIScale text next to the sliders will reset the value to 100%.
You can toggle between slider and exact input using the toggle button next to the header text "Zoom".
The text box only takes numbers from 0 to 1000 and pressing the Enter key or clicking away will submit the change.

Zoom:
[c/C4C4C4:    Changing the Zoom slider or Pressing the]
[c/C4C4C4:    plus or minus keys on your keyboard]
[c/C4C4C4:    (not the ones on the numpad) will zoom your]
[c/C4C4C4:    game in and out just like normal, but]
[c/C4C4C4:    instead of zooming from 100% to 200%,]
[c/C4C4C4:    you can zoom from 30% to 1000%]

[c/FF0000: When you zoom out the tiles don't load any further.]

If you cannot for whatever reason change the Zoom or UI Scale in game, you can change the "Zoom" and "UIScale" values inside the configuration file located at "Documents/My Games/Terraria/tModLoader/config.json" while the game is closed.

[c/FFE900:This mod allows you to zoom in and out much]
[c/FFE900:further than what's possible in Vanilla.]

[c/FFE900:Very useful to people who play in lower resolutions or]
[c/FFE900:who want to have high resolution sprites.]

[c/FFE900:You can also make the game turn upside down.]

Open the UI using the hotkey (default: 'B').

[c/C4C4C4:    game in and out just like normal, but]
[c/C4C4C4:    instead of zooming from 100% to 200%,]
[c/C4C4C4:    you can zoom from 20% to 1000%]
[c/C4C4C4:    and from -100% to -20% (upside down)]

[c/FF0000: When you zoom out the tiles don't load any further.]
[c/FF0000: This is not a bug!]

[c/C4C4C4:    once the zoom is negative.]

[c/FFE900:This mod allows you to zoom in and out much]
[c/FFE900:further than what's possible in Vanilla.]

[c/FFE900:Very useful to people who play in lower resolutions or]
[c/FFE900:who want to have high resolution sprites.]

[c/FFE900:You can also make the game turn upside down.]

Zoom (default: 1x):
[c/C4C4C4:    This is the main feature of the Mod.]
[c/C4C4C4:    Changing the Zoom slider or Pressing the]
[c/C4C4C4:    plus or minus keys on your keyboard]
[c/C4C4C4:    (not the ones on the numpad) will zoom your]
[c/C4C4C4:    game in and out just like normal, but]
[c/C4C4C4:    instead of zooming from 100% to 200%,]
[c/C4C4C4:    you can zoom from 20% to 1000%]
[c/C4C4C4:    and from -100% to -20% (upside down)]

[c/FF0000: When you zoom out the tiles don't load any further.]
[c/FF0000: This is not a bug!]

Lock screen (default: 'off'):
[c/C4C4C4:    Setting this to on or pressing the Hotkey,]
[c/C4C4C4:    locks your screen to the current position.]

[c/C4C4C4:    You can still move while it's locked]
[c/C4C4C4:    (Unlike Hero's Mod "Fly Camera tool").]

[c/C4C4C4:    Additionally, pressing the arrow keys]
[c/C4C4C4:    moves your screen in the direction.]

[c/C4C4C4:    Pressing the Hotkey again or setting]
[c/C4C4C4:    "Lock Screen" to 'off', unlocks your screen.]

Zoom Background (default: 'off'):
[c/C4C4C4:    This toggles if the background should zoom too.]

Flip Background (default: 'on'):
[c/C4C4C4:    This decides if the background should flip]
[c/C4C4C4:    once the zoom is negative.]

Hotbar scale (default: 1x):
[c/C4C4C4:    This changes how big your hotbar is.]

UI Scale (default: 1x): 
[c/C4C4C4:    Similar to "Zoom" but for the UI.]
[c/C4C4C4:    You can also change this by holding shift while]
[c/C4C4C4:    pressing plus or minus.]

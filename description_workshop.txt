This mod is open source on [url=https://github.com/NotLe0n/BetterZoom]GitHub[/url]. If you have a GitHub account, please give it a star!

The Camera Control portion of this mod has been moved to its separate mod called 
"[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2831018225]Camera Control[/url]". If you are a content creator, go check it out!

[h1]How to use:[/h1]

[h2]In Settings:[/h2]
Clicking on the Zoom or UIScale text next to the sliders will reset the value to 100%.
You can toggle between slider and exact input using the toggle button next to the header text "Zoom".
The text box only takes numbers from 0 to 1000 and pressing the Enter key or clicking away will submit the change.

[h3]Zoom:[/h3]
Changing the Zoom slider or Pressing the plus or minus keys on your keyboard (not the ones on the numpad) will zoom your game in and out just like normal,
but instead of zooming from 100% to 200%, you can zoom from 30% to 1000%

When you zoom out the tiles don't load any further. This is not a bug, but a limitation Terraria has!

[h3]UI Scale: [/h3]
You can now change the UI Scale from 30% to 600%. You can also change this by holding shift while pressing plus or minus.

[h2]Mod Config:[/h2]

[h3]Background Scale (default: 'off'):[/h3]
This toggles if the background should zoom too.

[h3]Cursor Scale (default: 1x):[/h3]
This changes the size of your cursor.

[h3]Min Zoom (default: 0.3x):[/h3]
This changes the minimum amount of zoom you can set.

[h3]Max Zoom (default: 10x):[/h3]
This changes the maximal amount of zoom you can set.


If you cannot for whatever reason change the Zoom or UI Scale in game, you can change the "Zoom" and "UIScale" values 
inside the configuration file located at "Documents/My Games/Terraria/tModLoader/config.json" while the game is closed.

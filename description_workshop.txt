[h1]How to use:[/h1]

[h2]In Settings:[/h2]

[h3]Zoom:[/h3]
Changing the Zoom slider or Pressing the plus or minus keys on your keyboard (not the ones on the numpad) will zoom your game in and out just like normal,
but instead of zooming from 100% to 200%, you can zoom from 30% to 1000%

When you zoom out the tiles don't load any further. This is not a bug!

[h3]UI Scale: [/h3]
You can now change the UI Scale from 30% to 600%. You can also change this by holding shift while pressing plus or minus.

[h2]Mod Config:[/h2]

[h3]Background Scale (default: 'off'):[/h3]
This toggles if the background should zoom too.

[h3]Cursor Scale (default: 1x):[/h3]
This changes the size of your cursor.
